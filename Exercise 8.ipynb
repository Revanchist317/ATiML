    "Must-link and cannot-link constraints are both binary, symmetric pair-wise limitations imposed on the clustering process. Their expressiveness is very similar with one exception being that must-link constraints are transitive (other data points clustered with one must-link data point must also link to other data point from that must-link) whereas cannot-link constraints aren't (although one useful property is that a cannot-link between two data points establishes the data points linked to one or the other cannot link to their respective clusters). They can be used to extend k-means clustering for example. \n",
